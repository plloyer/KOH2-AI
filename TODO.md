## War
- When declaring war, consider defensive pacts against you in strength calculation
- While in a war, the AI should always accept support in it's war if not winning by a good amount.
- Keep your war as short as possible.
- Ask for support in wars that you are not with a good war score and better strength

## Military
- Avoid walking in the radis of castle and cities if they can shoot you (have a barrack)
- Even if in a war, play defensive. Don't attack if your contry is not in a very defensible position.
- Defense is more important than offence

## Diplomacy
- The longest the relation has been with someone (bad or good), consider it. A long good relation should be more important and a long bad relation should be taken with care. Use this to decide to help the ally or declare war.
- When choosing your friend, check the relationship of your relations. For instance if you are friend with A, and A is friend with B. Try to be friend with B. Create trade relation, create non agression, mariage, support in wars (if you are ready for war) etc.
